# How can you contribute to the Sniffnet project?

## Did you find a bug?

If you have found a bug in the application, it'd be awesome if you could open an issue describing the problem.

You should include a title, a description, and possibly a screenshot demonstrating the problem.

Before opening an issue, please make sure the bug was not already reported.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

If you have detected a bug and solved it, please open a pull request with your patch.

Ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and your solution to that problem.

## Do you intend to propose a whole new feature or an improvement of an existing feature?

All proposals to enlarge or improve Sniffnet are warmly welcomed, join the discussion and don't hesitate to share your thoughts!

## None of the above?

In case you wish to contribute in a different way, you can consider helping me writing a `lib.rs` file or some tests on the application.

That'd be amazing!
